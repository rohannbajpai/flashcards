Modify this next.js app to have a landing page that asks for a openai api key and notes.

The user then clicks a "next button"

The website then makes a request to the openai api 4o-mini to make flashcards with a prompt that specifies the output format with a few examples. (few shot examples) For example:

<flashcards>
    <flashcard>
         <front>
         What is BGP?
         </front>
         <back>
         BGP is a protocol that allows Autonomous Systems
         to communicate with other Autonomous Systems via
         the Internet
         </back>
    </flashcard>
    <flashcard>
         <front>
         What is IP?
         </front>
         <back>
         IP is a protocol that enables the Internet.
         </back>
    </flashcard>
</flashcard>

The client side should then take this response, and parse it to create flashcards that can be flipped by clicking on them,
and navigated by clicking back and forth
